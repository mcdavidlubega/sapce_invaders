## Space Aliens

This is an implementation of space invaders using HTML CSS and Javascript. You can play the current build of the game [here](https://mcdavidlubega.github.io/sapce_invaders/)

This implementation makes extensive use of Javascript classes to implement various features. This project is a pasison project that is I work on in my free time. 

The goal is to eventually have a very exciting space shooter and hopefully learn a lot more about javascript and various ways to tackle challenging problems.

### Features.
Currently the following features have been implemented.

- Player can move and shoot
- Enemies can spawn in a grid 
- Basic enemy movement 
- Enemies can shoot
- Particle system to indicate enemy or player hits
- Star particles for pretties
- Projectiles classes for various projectiles
- Basic score system

### Todo
As I work on the project and learn more, there are several features I wish to implement. The folloeing are some of the features I plan to implement in no particular order.

- Enemy variety
- Dynamic obstacles - such as asteroids
- Better player and enemey movement.
- A more functional HUD
- An upgrade system
